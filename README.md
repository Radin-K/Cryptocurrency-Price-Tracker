## Personal note
this was my first web scrapping project and i learned alot from it.
untill now i really didnt know how the websites actually works and how we request to them
and how we recieve an response from them.
i read the requests and bs4 documents to understand how they work though this project really didnt
need the use of bs4 but i learned alot.
i also whatched a video to understand the basics of http request and response and what a header is.
this project was a good experience overall.
